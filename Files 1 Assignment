Que.1-Which function is used to open a file? What are the different modes of opening a file? Explain each mode
      of file opening.
Ans. open() Function- The open() function opens a file, and returns it as a file object. 
   
    * Different modes of opening a file:---
          Write Files :-
            f = open("test.txt", 'w')
            print(f.write)
    
          Read Files :-
            data = open("text.txt",'r')
    
          Write Files :-
            with open("new.txt", "w") as f:
            print(f.write())
    
          Open Files using With
            with open("new.txt", "r") as f:
            print(f.read())
    

Que.2-Why close() function is used? Why is it important to close a file?
Ans. Close() function- The close() function is used to close an open file.A file needs to be closed 
     after a read or write operation to release the memory allocated by the program.
    
Que.3-Write a python program to create a text file. Write ‘I want to become a Data Scientist’ in that file. Then
     close the file. Open this file and read the content of the file. 
Ans. 
     Write Python Program :-
            f = open("test.txt", 'w')
            print(f.write)
            
    Write File :-
            f.write(‘I want to become a Data Scientist’)
            f.close
     
    Open File :-
            f = open("test.txt", 'w')
        
    Read the content of file :-
            d = open("text.txt",'r')
            print(d.read)
            


Que.4- Explain the following with python code: read(), readline() and readlines().
Ans.  
     Write Python Program :-
            f = open("test.txt", 'w')
            print(f.write)
            f.close
            
            d = open("text.txt",'r')
            
    1- Read()-The read() method returns the specified number of bytes from the file
            print(d.read)
        
    
    2- Readline()-Python readline() method will return a line from the file when called.
            print(d.readline())
    
    3- Readlines()-The readlines() method returns a list containing each line in the file as a list item.
            print(d.raadlines())
        

Que.5- Explain why with statement is used with open(). What is the advantage of using with statement and
       open() together?
Ans.  
     The with statement works with the open() function to open a file
        
        Write Python Program :-
            f = open("test.txt", 'w')
            print(f.write)
            f.close
            
            with open("new.txt", "r") as f:
            print(f.read())
    
    Advantage of using with statement and open() togather-Using with means that the file will be closed as soon as you leave the block. This is beneficial because 
        closing a file is something that can easily be forgotten and ties up resources that you no longer need   
    

Que.6- Explain the write() and writelines() functions. Give a suitable example.
Ans.
     Write() Function- The write() method writes a specified text to the file.
            f = open("test.txt", 'w')
            print(f.write)
            f.close  
    
    Writelines() Function- The writelines() method writes the items of a list to the file. Where the texts will be inserted depends on the file mode and 
                        stream position.
                f = open("test.txt", 'w')
                n = []
                for i in range(5):
                    name = input("Enter name of employee")
                    n.append(name)
                    
                f.writelines(n)
                f.close()
                print("I want to become a doctor.")
