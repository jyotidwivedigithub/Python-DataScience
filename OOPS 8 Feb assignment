Que.1:- What is Abstraction in OOps? Explain with an example.
Ans. Abstraction is the process of hiding the internal details of an application from the outer world
    for example car
        class car :
    def __init__(self, year, make, model, speed):
        self.__year = year
        self.__make = make
        self.__model = model
        self.__speed = speed

c = car(2022,"maruti",800,70)
print(c.car_year)



Que.2:-Differentiate between Abstraction and Encapsulation. Explain with an example.
Ans. 1-Abstraction is the process of hiding the internal details of an application from the outer world
    Example-car
        class car :
    def __init__(self, year, make, model, speed):
        self.__year = year
        self.__make = make
        self.__model = model
        self.__speed = speed

c = car(2022,"maruti",800,70)
print(c.car_year)        
        
    2- Encapsulation refers the building of data, along with the methods that operate on that data, into
      a with the methods that operate on that data, into a single unit.
    Examle- car  
        class car :
    def __init__(self, year, make, model, speed):
        self.__year = year
        self.__make = make
        self.__model = model
        self.__speed = speed

    def set_speed(self,speed):                    # Invoke a function-Overriding
        self.__speed = 0 if speed < 0 else speed  # Getter & Setter

    def get_speed(self):
        return self.__speed
    
c = car(2022,"maruti",800,70)
print(c.set_speed(45))
print(c.get_speed())



Que.3:-What is abc module in python? Why is it used?
Ans.ABC is Abstract Base Classes module in python. It is used to declare a set of methods that must be created in any child class 
    built on top of this abstract class.
    

Que.4:-How can we achieve data abstraction?
Ans.Data abstraction can be achived through creating abstract classes and inheriting them later.


Que.5:-Can we create an instance of an abstract class? Explain your answer.
Ans.Abstract classes cannot be instantiated.but they can be subclassed. When an abstract class is subclassed, the subclass usually provides implementation
   for all of the abstract methods in its parent class.However, if it does not, then the subclass must also be declared abstract.
