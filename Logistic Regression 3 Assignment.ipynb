    "Q1. Explain the concept of precision and recall in the context of classification models.\n",
    "Ans. \n",
    "    Precision and recall are two important evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of classification models, especially in binary classification\n",
    "    problems. They provide insights into how well the model is performing in terms of correctly identifying positive instances and minimizing false positives\n",
    "    and false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.Precision: Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made by the model. It focuses on the \n",
    "      accuracy of positive predictions.\n",
    "        Precision = TP/(TP+FP)\n",
    "        \n",
