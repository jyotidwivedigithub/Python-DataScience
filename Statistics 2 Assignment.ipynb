    "Ans. Skewness is a statistical concept that describes the asymmetry or lack of symmetry in the distribution of data values within a dataset. It measures\n",

    "     and interpretability.\n",
    "    \n",

    "Ans. Covariance and correlation are both statistical measures used to describe the relationship between two variables.But both are different from each \n",
    "    other....\n",
    "    1.Covariance: It measures the degree to which two variables vary together. If the variables tend to show similar behavior (both increase or \n",
    "      decrease together), the covariance is positive.If one variable tends to increase when the other decreases, the covariance is negative.\n",
    "      It is scale-dependent; its value is affected by the units of measurement for X and Y. This makes it hard to interpret the strength of the \n",

    "        \n",
    "    2.Correlation:  It measures both the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. Unlike covariance, correlation is \n",
    "      dimensionless and normalized, typically ranging from -1 to +1. The most common measure of correlation is the Pearson correlation coefficient.\n",
    "      It is dimensionless and standardized. A correlation of +1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship, -1 indicates a perfect negative linear\n",

    "Ans. Outliers can significantly impact measures of central tendency and dispersion in a dataset. Central tendency measures, such as the mean, are \n",

    "    \n",
    "     Measures of Central Tendency ( Mean): \n",
    "            Example: Consider the dataset [10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 100]. The mean without the outlier is (10+15+20+25+30+)/5 = 20. However, if we include the \n",
    "            outlier (100), the mean becomes (10+15+20+25+30+100)/6 = 33.33. The presence of the outlier significantly increases the mean.\n",
    "            \n",
    "    Measures of Dispersion (Range, Standard Deviation):The range, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum values, can be greatly influenced\n",
    "         by outliers. If there is an extreme value, the range will be larger, indicating greater variability. Similar to the range, the standard deviation \n",
    "         is sensitive to outliers. Extreme values can increase the spread of the data, resulting in a larger standard deviation.\n",
    "            Example: Consider the dataset [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 100]. The range without the outlier is 100-5 = 95, but with the outlier, it becomes 100-5 = 95\n",
