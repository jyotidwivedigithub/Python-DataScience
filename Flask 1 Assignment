Ans.   
    Creating API....
        from flask import Flask
        app = Flask(__name__)

        @app.route("/")
        def hello_world():

        app.run(host="0.0.0.0")
        
    Oueput....
         [Running] python -u "/config/workspace/app.py"

Q3. What is App routing in Flask? Why do we use app routes?
Ans. App Routing- App Routing means mapping the URLs to a specific function that will handle the logic for that URL.
      Modern web frameworks use more meaningful URLs to help users remember the URLs and make navigation simpler. 
      Example: In our application, the URL (‚Äú/‚Äù) is associated with the root URL.

  route to show the following details:
  Company Name: ABC Corporation
  Location: India
  ontact Detail: 999-999-9999

      def company_info():
      return 'Company Name: ABC Corporation,Location: India,Contact Detail: 999-999-9999'

      if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run(host="0.0.0.0")
                                    
 Output...
