    "Ans. \n",
    "    The normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is a widely used probability distribution in statistics. It is characterized by \n",
    "    its bell-shaped curve, which is symmetrical around the mean. The parameters of the normal distribution are the mean (μ) and the standard deviation\n",

    "        Example: The heights of adult males in a given population.\n",

    "        Example: Intelligence Quotient (IQ) scores in a population.\n",
    "        Parameters: Mean IQ (μ) and standard deviation (σ) would indicate the average intelligence level and the spread of IQ scores in the population.\n",

    "          of the original distribution of the variables. This makes the normal distribution a fundamental concept in inferential statistics.\n",
    "        3.Parameter Estimation: In many statistical methods, the normal distribution is used as an assumption for parameter estimation. Maximum Likelihood\n",
    "          Estimation (MLE) and other estimation techniques often assume a normal distribution for the underlying data.  \n",
    "        4.Statistical Testing: Many statistical tests and procedures are based on the assumption of normality. For example, t-tests, analysis of \n",
    "          variance (ANOVA), and linear regression often assume normality in the residuals for valid interpretations of results.\n",
    "        5.Prediction and Control: In fields such as quality control and manufacturing, the normal distribution is used to model the variability of \n",

    "Q6. Consider a dataset with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. If we assume that the dataset\n",
    "    is normally distributed, what is the probability that a randomly selected observation will be greater\n",
    "    than 60? Use the appropriate formula and show your calculations.\n",
    "Ans. \n",
    "    To find the probability that a randomly selected observation from a normally distributed dataset is greater than 60, given that the mean (μ) \n",
    "    is 50 and the standard deviation (σ) is 10, we can use the properties of the normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "    First, we standardize the value 60 using the Z-score formula:\n",
    "        Z= (X−μ)/ σ\n",

    "        (1)X is the value we're interested in (60 in this case),\n",
    "        (2)μ is the mean (50), and\n",
    "        (3)σ is the standard deviation (10).\n",
    "        Z = (60-50)/10 = 1\n",
    "    So, the Z-score of 60 is 1. This means that 60 is one standard deviation above the mean in this distribution.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The Z-score tells us how many standard deviations away from the mean our value is. To find the probability that a randomly selected observation is\n",
    "    greater than 60, we need to find the area to the right of Z = 1 in the standard normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "    This is done using a standard normal distribution table or a statistical software. Standard normal distribution tables give the area to the left of\n",
    "    a Z-score. For Z = 1, this area is approximately 0.8413. However, we want the area to the right (since we're interested in values greater than 60).\n",
    "\n",
    "       The area to the right is given by:\n",
    "            P(X>60)=1−P(X≤60)\n",

    "            P(X>60)=0.1587\n",
    "\n",
