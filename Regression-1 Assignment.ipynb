    "Q1. Explain the difference between simple linear regression and multiple linear regression. Provide an example of each.\n",
    "Ans. Simple Linear Regression: In simple linear regression, there is only one predictor variable (independent variable) used to predict the dependent \n",
    "     variable. The relationship between the variables is assumed to be linear.\n",
    "    Example: Predicting house prices based on the size of the house (single predictor).\n",
    "\n",
    "     Multiple Linear Regression: In multiple linear regression, there are multiple predictor variables used to predict the dependent variable. The \n",
    "    relationship between the variables is assumed to be linear.\n",
    "    Example: Predicting house prices based on size, number of bedrooms, and location (multiple predictors).\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Q2. Discuss the assumptions of linear regression. How can you check whether these assumptions hold in a given dataset?\n",
    "Ans.The key assumptions of linear regression include linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, and normality of residuals. Assumptions can be checked \n",
    "    using diagnostic plots (e.g., residual plots, Q-Q plots), statistical tests (e.g., Shapiro-Wilk test for normality), and measures (e.g., variance\n",
    "    inflation factor for multicollinearity).\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "Q3. How do you interpret the slope and intercept in a linear regression model? Provide an example using a real-world scenario.\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "    Slope: The slope represents the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the independent variable, holding other variables \n",
    "           constant.\n",
    "    Intercept: The intercept represents the value of the dependent variable when all independent variables are zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example: In a linear regression model predicting exam scores based on hours of study, the slope indicates how much the exam score is expected to \n",
    "    increase for each additional hour of study, and the intercept represents the expected exam score when no study hours are logged.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "Q4. Explain the concept of gradient descent. How is it used in machine learning?\n",
    "Ans.Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss function in machine learning models. It iteratively updates the model \n",
    "    parameters (weights) in the direction of the steepest descent of the loss function gradient. By following the gradient, the algorithm converges \n",
    "    to the optimal parameter values that minimize the loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "Q5. Describe the multiple linear regression model. How does it differ from simple linear regression?\n",
    "Ans.Multiple linear regression is an extension of simple linear regression that involves multiple predictor variables to predict the dependent variable. \n",
    "    The model equation is represented as...\n",
    "              Y = β0+β1X1+β2X2+β3X3+...+βnXn+ϵ\n",
    "    Where Y is the independent variable, X1,X2,X3,...,Xn are the predictor variable,β0,β1,β2,..,βn are the coefficients(intercept and slopes), and \n",
    "    ϵ is the error. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "Q6. Explain the concept of multicollinearity in multiple linear regression. How can you detect and address this issue?\n",
    "Ans.Multicollinearity occurs when predictor variables in a multiple linear regression model are highly correlated with each other. It can lead to \n",
    "    unstable coefficient estimates and inflated standard errors. Detection methods include correlation matrices, variance inflation factor (VIF), \n",
    "    and condition indices. Addressing multicollinearity involves removing correlated predictors or using regularization techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. Describe the polynomial regression model. How is it different from linear regression?\n",
    "Ans.Polynomial regression is a form of regression analysis in which the relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable is\n",
    "    modeled as an nth degree polynomial. Unlike linear regression, which assumes a linear relationship, polynomial regression allows for more complex,\n",
    "    nonlinear relationships between variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "Q8. What are the advantages and disadvantages of polynomial regression compared to linear regression? In what situations would you prefer to use \n",
    "   polynomial regression?\n",
    "Ans.Advantages and Disadvantages of Polynomial Regression are...\n",
    "    1.Advantages: Polynomial regression can capture nonlinear relationships between variables and may provide better fit to the data compared to linear\n",
    "      regression. It is flexible and can accommodate more complex patterns.\n",
    "    2.Disadvantages: Polynomial regression can lead to overfitting, especially with high-degree polynomials. It may result in less interpretable models\n",
    "      compared to linear regression. Additionally, extrapolation beyond the range of observed data may be unreliable.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    Use Cases: Polynomial regression is useful when the relationship between variables is nonlinear and cannot be adequately captured by linear models.\n",
    "    It can be applied in areas such as physics, engineering, and economics where nonlinear relationships are common. However, careful consideration of\n",
    "    model complexity and validation techniques is necessary to avoid overfitting.\n",
