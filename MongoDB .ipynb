    "Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use\n",
    "    MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "Ans. MongoDB- MongoDB is a popular NoSQL document-oriented database that stores data in JSON-like documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Non-relational database- Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are databases that do \n",
    "        not use the traditional relational database management system model. Non-relational databases store \n",
    "        data in flexible formats, such as key-value pairs, documents, or graphs, which allows for easier scaling \n",
    "        and handling of unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where the data is unstructured, has varying or unknown \n",
    "    schema, and where performance is a critical requirement. For example, MongoDB is commonly used in industries \n",
    "    such as e-commerce, social media, and healthcare, where the data is constantly changing and requires fast access \n",
    "    to large amounts of data.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "Ans. Features of MongoDB- \n",
    "        1.Document-oriented storage: MongoDB stores data in flexible and dynamic JSON-like documents, which allows developers \n",
    "          to store data in a way that best suits their application's needs.\n",
    "        2.Flexible schema: MongoDB does not enforce a fixed schema like traditional SQL databases, which makes it easier to work\n",
    "          with unstructured data.\n",
    "        3.High availability: MongoDB provides automatic replication and failover, which ensures that the data is always available \n",
    "          and that there is no single point of failure.\n",
    "        4.Scalability: MongoDB can easily scale horizontally by adding more nodes to a cluster, which makes it ideal for handling \n",
    "          large volumes of data.\n",
    "        5.Indexing: MongoDB supports indexing on any field, which makes querying the database faster and more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "        \n",
    "Q3. Write a code to connect MongoDB to Python. Also, create a database and a collection in MongoDB.\n",
    "Ans.\n",

    "    \n",
    "    # Connect mongodb to python.\n",
    "    client = pymongo.MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27017/labDB\")\n",

    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "Q4. Using the database and the collection created in question number 3, write a code to insert one record,\n",
    "    and insert many records. Use the find() and find_one() methods to print the inserted record.\n",
    "Ans.     \n",
    "    import pymongo\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Connect mongodb to python.\n",

    "Q5. Explain how you can use the find() method to query the MongoDB database. Write a simple code to\n",
    "    demonstrate this.\n",
    "Ans. The find() method with no parameters returns all documents from a collection and returns all fields for the documents.\n",

    "Q6. Explain the sort() method. Give an example to demonstrate sorting in MongoDB.\n",
    "Ans. The sort() method is used in MongoDB to sort the documents in a collection based on one or more fields.\n",
