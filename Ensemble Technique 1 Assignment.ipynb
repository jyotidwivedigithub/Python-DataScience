    "Q1. What is an ensemble technique in machine learning?\n",
    "Ans. Ensemble technique is a ML technique that combines several base models in order to produce one optical predictive model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Why are ensemble techniques used in machine learning?\n",
    "Ans.  Ensemble techniques are used in machine learning to improve predictive performance, reduce overfitting, and increase \n",
    "     robustness by combining the strengths of multiple models.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Q3. What is bagging?\n",
    "Ans.Bagging, or Bootstrap Aggregating, is a technique in ensemble learning where multiple models are trained independently\n",
    "    on different subsets of the training data, often with replacement. The final prediction is typically the average (for regression) \n",
    "    or the majority vote (for classification) of the predictions made by individual models.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Q4. What is boosting?\n",
    "Ans. Boosting is another ensemble technique where models are trained sequentially, with each model focusing on the examples that previous\n",
    "    models struggled with. Boosting algorithms assign weights to data points and adjust them at each iteration to give more importance to\n",
    "    misclassified data points.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Q5. What are the benefits of using ensemble techniques?\n",
    "Ans. The benefits of using ensemble techniques include improved predictive performance, reduced overfitting, increased stability, and \n",
    "    the ability to capture complex relationships in data.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Q6. Are ensemble techniques always better than individual models?\n",
    "Ans. While ensemble techniques can often lead to improved performance and robustness, they are not guaranteed to outperform individual\n",
    "    models in all scenarios. The effectiveness of ensemble techniques depends on the characteristics of the dataset, the choice of base models,\n",
    "    and the design of the ensemble itself. It's essential to evaluate the performance of ensemble techniques carefully in the context of specific\n",
    "    machine learning tasks.\n",
    "     Ensemble techniques are powerful tools in machine learning, but whether they are always better than individual models depends on various factors:\n",

    "Q7. How is the confidence interval calculated using bootstrap?\n",
    "Ans. The confidence interval calculated using bootstrap involves resampling from the observed data to estimate the sampling distribution of a statistic,\n",
    "    such as the mean, median, or standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.Bootstrap Resampling:\n",
    "        -Randomly select samples (with replacement) from the observed data. Each bootstrap sample should have the same size as the original dataset.\n",
    "        -Repeat this process multiple times (e.g., 1000 times) to create a set of bootstrap samples.\n",
    "    2.Calculate Statistic:\n",
    "        -For each bootstrap sample, compute the statistic of interest (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation).\n",
    "    3.Construct Confidence Interval:\n",
    "        -Determine the desired confidence level, typically 95%.\n",
    "        -Sort the bootstrap sample statistics in ascending order.\n",
    "        -Calculate the lower and upper percentiles of the sorted bootstrap sample statistics corresponding to the desired confidence level.\n",
    "        -The resulting range between the lower and upper percentiles forms the confidence interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "    For example, to calculate a 95% confidence interval for the mean using bootstrap:\n",
    "        -Compute the mean for each bootstrap sample.\n",
    "        -Sort the bootstrap sample means.\n",
    "        -Determine the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the sorted bootstrap sample means.\n",
    "        -The range between these percentiles forms the 95% confidence interval for the mean.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Q8. How does bootstrap work and What are the steps involved in bootstrap?\n",
    "Ans. Bootstrap is a resampling technique used to estimate the sampling distribution of a statistic by repeatedly sampling with replacement from the \n",
    "    observed data. The goal is to obtain estimates of the sampling distribution without assuming any specific distributional form for the data using \n",
    "    following steps....\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.Original Sample:\n",
    "        -Begin with a dataset containing observations or samples.\n",
    "    2.Resampling:\n",
    "        -Draw a sample (bootstrap sample) of the same size as the original dataset.\n",
    "        -Sampling is done with replacement, meaning that each observation in the original dataset can be selected multiple times or not at all in the \n",
    "          bootstrap sample.\n",
    "    3.Statistic Calculation:\n",
    "        -Calculate the statistic of interest (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation, correlation coefficient) from the bootstrap sample.\n",
    "        -This statistic could be anything that characterizes the data, and it's typically the same statistic that you want to estimate from the \n",
    "          original data.\n",
    "    4.Repeat:\n",
    "        -Repeat steps 2 and 3 a large number of times (e.g., 1000 iterations).\n",
    "        -Each iteration involves drawing a new bootstrap sample and calculating the statistic of interest.\n",
    "    5.Bootstrap Distribution:\n",
    "        -Collect the calculated statistics from each bootstrap sample.\n",
    "        -This collection of statistics forms the bootstrap distribution of the statistic of interest.\n",
    "    6.Estimate Confidence Interval or Variability:\n",
    "        -Use the bootstrap distribution to estimate the variability of the statistic.\n",
    "        -Construct confidence intervals or estimate standard errors based on percentiles or other methods.\n",

    "Q9. A researcher wants to estimate the mean height of a population of trees. They measure the height of a sample of 50 trees and obtain a mean height \n",
    "    of 15 meters and a standard deviation of 2 meters. Use bootstrap to estimate the 95% confidence interval for the population mean height.\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "    To estimate the 95% confidence interval for the population mean height using bootstrap, we will resample with replacement from the sample of 50 \n",
    "    tree heights and calculate the mean height for each resampled dataset. Then, we will use the distribution of these resampled means to construct\n",
