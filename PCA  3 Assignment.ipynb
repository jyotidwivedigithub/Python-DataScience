    "Q2. What is eigen decomposition and what is its significance in linear algebra?\n",
    "Ans.-Eigen decomposition is a technique used in linear algebra to decompose a matrix into its eigenvectors and eigenvalues.\n",
    "        1. In linear algebra,an eigenvector or characteristic vector of a linear transformation is a nonzero vector that changes at most by a scalar\n",

    "        3.The Eigen decomposition of a matrix allows us to express the matrix in terms of its eigenvectors and eigenvalues. This decomposition is useful\n",
    "         in many applications such as signal processing, image compression, and machine learning. For example, in principal component analysis (PCA), \n",
    "        Eigen decomposition is used to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset by finding the most important eigenvectors that capture the most variation\n",
    "        in the data\n",
    "        \n",
    "    Eigen decomposition is a powerful technique in linear algebra that allows us to understand the geometric and dynamical properties of a matrix.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Q3. What are the conditions that must be satisfied for a square matrix to be diagonalizable using the Eigen-Decomposition approach? Provide a brief \n",
    "    proof to support your answer.\n",
    "Ans.-For a square matrix to be diagonalizable using Eigen-Decomposition approach, it must satisfy the following two conditions:\n",
    "        1.The matrix must be square, i.e., it must have an equal number of rows and columns.\n",
    "        2.The matrix must have n linearly independent eigenvectors, where n is the dimension of the matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Suppose we have an n x n matrix A that is diagonalizable, i.e., it can be expressed as Av = λv , where  λ is a diagonal matrix, and v is a\n",
    "        matrix whosecolumns are the eigenvectors of A. \n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    "Q4. What is the significance of the spectral theorem in the context of the Eigen-Decomposition approach? How is it related to the diagonalizability\n",
    "    of a matrix? Explain with an example.\n",
    "Ans.-The spectral theorem is a fundamental result in linear algebra that connects the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix to its diagona-\n",
    "     -lization. Specifically, it states that any real symmetric matrix can be diagonalized by an orthogonal matrix, and the resulting diagonal matrix\n",
    "     will have the eigenvalues of the original matrix on its diagonal.\n",
    "\n",
    "        This theorem is significant in the context of the Eigen-Decomposition approach because it provides a necessary and sufficient condition for a \n",
    "    matrix to be diagonalizable. Specifically, a matrix A is diagonalizable if and only if it is similar to a diagonal matrix λ, which means that there\n",
    "    exists an invertible matrix v such that Av = λv. The columns of v are the eigenvectors of A, and the diagonal entries of λ are the corresponding \n",
    "    eigenvalues.\n",
    "\n",
    "        In the case of a real symmetric matrix, the spectral theorem guarantees that the diagonalization is possible using an orthogonal matrix for v.\n",
    "    This means that the eigenvectors of the matrix are orthonormal, and hence, the transformation to the diagonal form does not change the lengths or \n",
    "    angles of the vectors. This property makes the spectral theorem particularly useful in many applications, such as in the study of rotations and \n",
    "    vibrations in physics and engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "Q5. How do you find the eigenvalues of a matrix and what do they represent?\n",
    "Ans.-An eigenvector of a matrix A is a non-zero vector v such that when A is multiplied by v, the result is a scalar multiple of v. In other words,\n",
    "     Av = λv, where λ is a scalar known as the eigenvalue.\n",
    "\n",
    "     To find the eigenvalues of a matrix, one needs to solve the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0, where A is the matrix, λ is the eigenvalue,\n",
    "    and I is the identity matrix. This equation yields the values of λ that satisfy the condition Av = λv.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Q6. What are eigenvectors and how are they related to eigenvalues?\n",
    "Ans.-Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are closely related because each eigenvalue corresponds to a set of eigenvectors that are solutions to the equation \n",
    "     Av = λv. In general, there can be multiple eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue, and they form a subspace known as the eigenspace. The\n",
    "     dimension of the eigenspace corresponding to an eigenvalue is known as the algebraic multiplicity of that eigenvalue.\n",
    "        \n",
    "Q7. Can you explain the geometric interpretation of eigenvectors and eigenvalues?\n",
    "Ans.-Yes, the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a matrix can be interpreted geometrically in several ways, depending on the context.\n",
    "        One common interpretation is in terms of linear transformations. When a matrix is multiplied by a vector, it represents a linear transformation\n",
    "    that maps the vector to a new location in space. An eigenvector of the matrix represents a special type of vector that is only scaled by the transfor-\n",
    "    -mation, without being rotated or sheared. In other words, the direction of the eigenvector remains unchanged after the transformation, and the only \n",
    "    change is in its length, which is multiplied by the eigenvalue.\n",
    "\n",
    "        The geometric interpretation of eigenvectors and eigenvalues can be seen in the following way: suppose we have a square matrix A and an \n",
    "    eigenvector v of A with corresponding eigenvalue λ. Then, when A is multiplied by v, the result is a vector that is collinear with v and has \n",
    "    length λ times the length of v. In other words, A scales the vector v by a factor of λ. This scaling factor determines the direction and amount\n",
    "    of stretch (or compression) of the vector under the transformation represented by A.\n",
    "\n",
    "      In a 2D transformation matrix, for example, the eigenvectors correspond to the directions that are stretched or compressed by the transformation,\n",
    "    and the eigenvalues correspond to the amount of stretching or compression in each direction. The eigenvectors form the basis for the eigenspace of\n",
    "    the matrix, which is the subspace spanned by all the eigenvectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "       Another interpretation of eigenvectors and eigenvalues is in terms of the principal axes of an ellipsoid. When a matrix A is used to transform \n",
    "    a unit sphere, the resulting shape is an ellipsoid. The eigenvectors of A are the directions along which the ellipsoid is stretched or compressed, \n",
    "    and the corresponding eigenvalues are the lengths of the principal axes of the ellipsoid. This interpretation is particularly useful in data analysis\n",
    "    and machine learning, where the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a covariance matrix can be used to extract the principal components of a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "       The geometric interpretation of eigenvectors and eigenvalues provides a useful way to understand the behavior of linear transformations and to \n",

    "        1.Principal Component Analysis (PCA): PCA is a commonly used technique in data analysis and machine learning to reduce the dimensionality of\n",

    "\n",
    "     Eigen decomposition is a powerful tool that has many applications in various fields, including data analysis, image processing, quantum mechanics,\n",

    "\n",
    "Q9. Can a matrix have more than one set of eigenvectors and eigenvalues?\n",
    "Ans.-Yes, it is possible for a matrix to have more than one set of eigenvectors and eigenvalues. This occurs when the matrix is not diagonalizable, \n",
    "    which can happen if it has repeated eigenvalues or if it does not have enough linearly independent eigenvectors to form a complete basis. In this \n",
    "    case, it may be necessary to use alternative methods, such as singular value decomposition, to decompose the matrix.\n",
