    "     The mean (μ) and variance (σ**2  ) in probability distributions provide insights into the central tendency and spread of the distribution, \n",
    "     respectively, mean and variance are related in the Binomial and Poisson distributions...\n",

    "    1.Binomial Distribution:For a Binomial distribution with parameters n (number of trials) and p (probability of success in each trial):\n",

    "        variance(σ**2): σ**2 = np(1-p)\n",

    "        Variance (σ**2): σ**2 =  λ\n",
    "        \n",
    "        For the Binomial distribution, the variance is influenced by both the number of trials (n) and the probability of success (p). When \n",
    "    p is close to 0 or 1, the variance is relatively small.\n",
    "        For the Poisson distribution, the variance is solely determined by the average rate of events (λ). The variance is equal to the mean, \n",

    "Q10. In normal distribution with respect to mean position, where does the least frequent data appear?\n",
    "Ans. In a normal distribution, also known as a Gaussian distribution or bell curve, the data is symmetrically distributed around the mean. The mean \n",
    "    represents the central point of the distribution, and the shape of the curve is such that data points are more concentrated around the mean and \n",
    "    become less frequent as you move away from the mean in either direction."
