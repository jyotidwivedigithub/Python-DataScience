Q1. Explain with an example each when to use a for loop and a while loop.
Ans. For Loop:- The for loop is used to run a block of code for a certain number of times. It is used to iterate over any 
                sequences such as list, tuple, string, etc.
           names = ["sita","meera","kiara"]
           for name in names:
                print(name)
                
    While Loop:-While Loop is used to execute a block of statements repeatedly until a given condition is satisfied.
           a=1
           while a <= 10:
                print(a)
                a=a+1
       
        
Q2. Write a python program to print the sum and product of the first 10 natural numbers using for
    and while loop.
Ans. Using For Loop:-
                  # Sum of first 10 natural numbers using for loop
                    sum = 0
                    for i in range(1, 11):
                    sum += i
                    print("Sum of first 10 natural numbers is:", sum)

                 # Product of first 10 natural numbers using for loop
                    product = 1
                    for i in range(1, 11):
                    product *= i
                    print("Product of first 10 natural numbers is:", product)
                    
    Using While Loop:-
               # Sum of first 10 natural numbers using while loop
                    sum = 0
                    i = 1
                    while i <= 10:
                        sum += i
                        i += 1
                    print("Sum of first 10 natural numbers is:", sum)

              # Product of first 10 natural numbers using while loop
                    product = 1
                    i = 1
                    while i <= 10:
                        product *= i
                        i += 1
                    print("Product of first 10 natural numbers is:", product) 
    
    
    
Q3. Create a python program to compute the electricity bill for a household.
Ans. 
    units = int(input("Enter the number of units consumed: "))

  # Calculate the electricity bill based on the number of units consumed
    if units <= 100:
        bill_amount = units * 4.5
    elif units <= 200:
        bill_amount = 100 * 4.5 + (units - 100) * 6
    elif units <= 300:
        bill_amount = 100 * 4.5 + 100 * 6 + (units - 200) * 10
    else:
        bill_amount = 100 * 4.5 + 100 * 6 + 100 * 10 + (units - 300) * 20


    print("Electricity bill amount: Rs.", bill_amount)

    
    
Q4. Create a list of numbers from 1 to 100. Use for loop and while loop to calculate the cube of each
    number and if the cube of that number is divisible by 4 or 5 then append that number in a list and print
    that list.
    The per-unit charges in rupees are as follows: For the first 100 units, the user will be charged Rs. 4.5 per
    unit, for the next 100 units, the user will be charged Rs. 6 per unit, and for the next 100 units, the user will
    be charged Rs. 10 per unit, After 300 units and above the user will be charged Rs. 20 per unit.
    You are required to take the units of electricity consumed in a month from the user as input.
    Your program must pass this test case: when the unit of electricity consumed by the user in a month is
    310, the total electricity bill should be 2250.
Ans.
    # Create a list of numbers from 1 to 100
    numbers = list(range(1, 101))

    # Use a for loop to calculate the cube of each number
    cubes = []
    for num in numbers:
        cube = num ** 3
        if cube % 4 == 0 or cube % 5 == 0:
            cubes.append(num)

    # Print the list of numbers whose cubes are divisible by 4 or 5
    print("Numbers whose cubes are divisible by 4 or 5:", cubes)
    
    

   # Take input from the user for the number of units consumed
   units = int(input("Enter the number of units consumed: "))

  # Calculate the electricity bill based on the number of units consumed
    if units <= 100:
        bill_amount = units * 4.5
    elif units <= 200:
        bill_amount = 100 * 4.5 + (units - 100) * 6
    elif units <= 300:
        bill_amount = 100 * 4.5 + 100 * 6 + (units - 200) * 10
    else:
        bill_amount = 100 * 4.5 + 100 * 6 + 100 * 10 + (units - 300) * 20


    print("Electricity bill amount: Rs.", bill_amount)

    
    
Q5. Write a program to filter count vowels in the below-given string.
    string = "I want to become a data scientist"
Ans.
   string = "I want to become a data scientist"

   # Define a function to count vowels
   def count_vowels(s):
        vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
        count = 0
        for char in s:
            if char in vowels:
                count += 1
        return count

  # Filter and count vowels in the input string
  num_vowels = count_vowels(string)

  # Display the result
  print("The number of vowels in the string is:", num_vowels)
