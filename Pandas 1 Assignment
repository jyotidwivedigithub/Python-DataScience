Q1. Create a Pandas Series that contains the following data: 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, and 42. Then, print the series.
Ans.    import pandas as pd
        x = [4,8,15,16,23,42]
        var = pd.series(x)
        print(var)
        
        
Q2. Create a variable of list type containing 10 elements in it, and apply pandas.Series function on the
variable print it.
Ans.    import pandas as pd
        x1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
        var1 = pd.series(x1)
        print(var1)


Q3. Create a Pandas DataFrame that contains the following data:
Then, print the DataFrame.
Ans. 
    import pandas as pd

    data = {
         'name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Claire'],
         'age': [25, 30, 27],
         'gender': ['Female', 'Male', 'Female']
  
    }

    df = pd.DataFrame(data)
    print(df)


Q4. What is ‘DataFrame’ in pandas and how is it different from pandas.series? Explain with an example.
Ans. DataFrame is a two-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of different types.
     
    Series is a one-dimensional labeled array that can hold data of any type, while a DataFrame is a 
    two-dimensional labeled array that is made up of multiple Series objects and can hold columns of 
    different data types.
    Example:
        DataFrame- import pandas as pd
                   l=[1,2,3,4]
                   var=pd.DataFrame(l)
                   print(var)
        
        DataSeries- import pandas as pd
                    l=[1,2,3,4]
                    var=pd.series(l)
                    print(var)
                    
                    
Q5. What are some common functions you can use to manipulate data in a Pandas DataFrame? Can
you give an example of when you might use one of these functions?
Ans. There are many functions available in Pandas to manipulate data in a DataFrame. Here are some of 
     the most common ones...
    Example:   
                      import pandas as pd
                      df = pd.read_csv("p2.csv")
    
    1.'df.head'-      df.head()
    2.'df.tail'-      df.tail()
    3.'type'-         type(df)
    4.'df.column'-    df.columns()
    5.'df.dtype'-     df.dtypes()
    6.'df.index'-     df.index()
    
    
Q6. Which of the following is mutable in nature Series, DataFrame, Panel?
Ans. Series, DataFrame and Panel all are mutable in nature.


Q7. Create a DataFrame using multiple Series. Explain with an example.
Ans. 
    import pandas as pd

    # create a Series for the first column
    name = pd.Series(['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David'])

    # create a Series for the second column
    age = pd.Series([25, 30, 35, 40])

    # create a Series for the third column
    gender = pd.Series(['female', 'male', 'male', 'male'])

    # create the DataFrame by passing a dictionary of Series objects
    df = pd.DataFrame({'Name': name, 'Age': age, 'Gender': gender})

    print(df)
